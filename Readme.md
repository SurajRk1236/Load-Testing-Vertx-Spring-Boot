#  Custom Load Testing Tool with Monitoring and Visualization

This project provides a solution for **API performance testing** with real-time monitoring and visualization capabilities. It includes a **Custom Load Testing Tool** built using **Vert.x**, and integrations with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor and visualize performance metrics dynamically.

## Features

- **Custom Load Testing Tool**: Efficiently generates high-volume API requests using Vert.x's non-blocking architecture.
- **Dynamic Test Configuration**: Execute load tests dynamically via curl commands, configuring concurrent users and requests per user directly from the CLI.
- **API Performance Testing**: Measure key performance metrics, such as throughput, latency, and error rates, to evaluate API responsiveness under load.
- **Real-Time Metrics Monitoring**: Collect performance data like total requests, request duration, and success rates during the load tests.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Create intuitive Grafana dashboards to visualize real-time metrics and identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Scalable Execution**: Simulate real-world scenarios and test system scalability under high concurrency using asynchronous execution.
